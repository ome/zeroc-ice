This is a PHP version of the Ice "optional" demo client.

First, start the optional demo server, using any of the supported
language mappings, on this host.

Then, if you are using an RPM installation of IcePHP, run the PHP
client:

$ php -f Client.php

Otherwise, review the comments in the php.ini file to determine whether
any changes are needed for your environment, and then run the PHP
client:

$ php -c php.ini -f Client.php

An alternate version of the client that uses PHP namespaces is
provided as Client_ns.php.
