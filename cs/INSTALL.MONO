Mono Version
------------

This version of Ice for .NET requires Mono version 2.0.1 or later.

Note that IceSSL is not currently supported for Mono.


Operating System
----------------

Ice for .NET is expected to build and run properly on any recent Linux
distribution for x86 and x86_64. However, Ice is officially supported
only on:

 - SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2 for i586 or x86_64 (SLES 11)

You need to install the mono-core and the mono-devel RPMs to build Ice
for .NET on Linux.


Build instructions
------------------

Unpack the source archive. The .NET sources will be contained in the
Ice-3.5.0/cs subdirectory.

You will need the Slice to C# translator (slice2cs) and supporting
executables and libraries. You can download a binary distribution from
the ZeroC web site, or you can build Ice for C++ yourself.

Binary distributions for the supported platforms are available at

  http://www.zeroc.com/download.html

To build Ice for .NET, run

$ make

in the cs subdirectory.

If you have not built Ice for C++ in the cpp subdirectory, then you
need to set (and export) ICE_HOME to the top-level directory of an Ice
for C++ installation. (The makefiles look there for a bin directory
that contains slice2cs.)


Managed Code
------------

By default, Ice for .NET uses unmanaged code for performing protocol
compression and for handling signals in the Ice.Application class
on Windows. You can build a managed version of Ice for .NET that
lacks the aforementioned features by editing config/Make.rules.cs and
uncommenting the MANAGED=yes line before you build.


Configuring the bzip library
----------------------------

The bin directory contains a file Ice.dll.config that specifies
the bzip2 library. You need to check that the library name specified
for the target attribute matches the name of the bzip2 library on your
machine. If the target attribute does not specify the correct name
or if bzip2 is not installed, the Ice run time silently runs without
protocol compression.

To test whether you have set the attribute correctly, run the server
in demo/Ice/minimal as follows:

$ MONO_LOG_LEVEL=info MONO_LOG_MASK=dll mono --debug server.exe

This produces trace output that shows whether the bzip2 library could
be located at run time. If the library could be found, you will see a
line of trace as follows:

Mono-INFO: Found as 'BZ2_bzlibVersion'.


Running Mono applications on Linux
----------------------------------

Mono binaries are interpreted so, given a binary called "foo", you
have to run the Mono interpreter with an argument "foo" to execute
that binary:

$ mono foo

If you want to avoid having to explicitly invoke the Mono interpreter,
please follow the "Registering .exe as non-native binaries"
instructions at

  http://www.mono-project.com/Guide:Running_Mono_Applications


Running the tests
-----------------

Some of the Ice for .NET tests employ applications that are part of the
Ice for C++ distribution. If you have not built Ice for C++ from the cpp
subdirectory then you need to set the ICE_HOME environment variable to
the path where these applications are installed for these tests to run
properly:

$ export ICE_HOME=/opt/Ice-3.5.0

Python is required to run the test suite:

  http://www.python.org/download

To run the tests, open a command window and change to the top-level
directory. At the command prompt, execute:

$ python allTests.py

You can also run tests individually by changing to the test directory
and running this command:

$ python run.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of "ok" messages. In
case of a failure, the tests abort with "failed".


Running the demos
-----------------

To run the demos, you need to have Ice-3.5.0/cs/bin in your MONO_PATH
or install the Ice DLLs in the GAC. See the README file in each demo
directory for a description of each demo.


Installation
------------

Open config/Make.rules.cs and change the "prefix" variable to hold the
top-level installation directory. This directory will be created
automatically if necessary. Also review the comments for the "GACINSTALL"
variable and decide whether to enable it. Next, run

$ make install

After installation, add the directory containing the libraries to your
MONO_PATH. When building applications, you need to reference the
libraries with the -r option to mcs.

Alternatively, you can add the libraries to the global assembly cache.
To do this, either set GACINSTALL before building the libraries, or use

$ gacutil -i <library.dll>

Once installed in the cache, the assemblies will always be located
correctly without having to set environment variables.

Finally, you could also copy the necessary libraries into the
directory that contains the .exe for your application.
