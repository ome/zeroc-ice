To run this demo, open two terminal windows. In the first window,
start the IceBox server:

$ iceboxnet.exe --Ice.Config=config.icebox

In the second window, run the client:

$ client.exe

To shut down IceBox, use iceboxadmin:

$ iceboxadmin --Ice.Config=config.admin shutdown


Note for 64 bit Windows:

In order to run this demo under 64 bit Windows you must add
<ice-install-dir>\bin to your PATH, since that is where iceboxnet.exe
is located.
