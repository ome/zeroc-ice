Note for Mono:

    For this demo to work properly using Mono on Linux, you must
    configure Linux to recognize Mono binaries. More details are
    provided in the release notes:

    http://doc.zeroc.com/display/Ice/Release+Notes

    Alternatively, if you do not want to reconfigure your kernel, edit
    application.xml and change the <server> element to read:

    <server id="SimpleServer" exe="mono" activation="on-demand">
      <option>./server.exe</option>

    Note that we use "mono" (the Mono interpreter) as the executable
    and pass the path name of the actual server as an argument.

To run the demo, first start the IceGrid service:

$ icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid

In a separate window:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "application add 'application.xml'"
$ client.exe

This will deploy the application described in the file
"application.xml" and start the client.

Messages will be displayed in the IceGrid service window.

You can also use the descriptors in the following files to deploy the
application:

- application_with_template.xml: These descriptors demonstrate the use
  of templates for the server definition. Templates make it easy to
  deploy multiple instances of the same server.

- application_with_replication.xml: These descriptors demonstrate the
  use of replication to balance the load of the application over
  several servers.

If you have already deployed the application, you can update it to try
a new set of descriptors, for example:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "application update 'application_with_template.xml'"

When using the descriptors from 'application_with_template.xml' or
'application_with_replication.xml', you can easily deploy more servers
based on the `SimpleServer' template. For example, you can use the
following command to deploy a new server:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "server template instantiate Simple node1 SimpleServer index=4"


Vista Note
----------

On Vista-derived operating systems, the IceGrid node may emit the
following warning:

  warning: Unable to lookup the performance counter name:
  Unable to connect to the specified computer or the computer is
  offline. This usually occurs when you do not have sufficient
  privileges.

This issue can be resolved by granting appropriate permissions to the
node's user account. Please refer to the Troubleshooting section of
Appendix H in the Ice manual for more information.
