Oracle OCCI demo
================

This demo shows how to implement an Ice server that uses Oracle
through its Oracle C++ Call Interface (OCCI) API.

It is a fairly simple demo that illustrates how to:

 - Map relational data to Ice objects, in particular convert between 
   Ice and OCCI types.
 - Use an OCCI pool to provide Oracle connections to Ice requests.
 - Use an Ice servant locator.


Building the demo
-----------------

OCCI is only available for some C++ compilers. Make sure to select a 
platform and C++ compiler supported by both Ice and OCCI.

OCCI oracle drivers are available at:

 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/occidownloads-083553.html

- Setup an Oracle database with the traditional EMP/DEPT schema. 
  With Oracle server 11.1, the corresponding SQL script is 
  $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utlsampl.sql.

- Ensure that your user (by default, scott) has the CREATE VIEW
  privilege.

- Create object types and views using the provided createTypes.sql 
  script. For example:

     % sqlplus /nolog
     SQL> @createTypes.sql

  This script assumes that you can connect to your database with 
  'scott/tiger@orcl'. If you need another connect-string, edit
  createTypes.sql.

- Oracle's ott utility needs to connect to the database in order to 
  generate code from the file 'DbTypes.typ'. The default connect-
  string is "scott/tiger@orcl". If this is not appropriate, edit the
  corresponding Makefile target, or the Custom build rule for
  Visual Studio projects. 

- Set the environment variable ORACLE_HOME to point to your Oracle
  installation home directory.

- On Windows with Visual Studio 2010 Project Files, add the 
  following directories to your Visual C++ environment: 

  - Include files: $(ORACLE_HOME)\oci\include

  - Library files: $(ORACLE_HOME)\oci\lib\msvc\vc10
                   $(ORACLE_HOME)\oci\lib\msvc

    (make sure to list the driver folder before lib\msvc)

  - Executable files: 

    $(ORACLE_HOME)\oci\lib\msvc\vc10;$(ORACLE_HOME)\bin

  - If OCCI driver isn't installed in the standard location,
  update Library and Executable files to match your installation
  directories

- On Windows, when using nmake Makefiles, please review 
  Makefile.mak.

- Then build as usual.


Running the demo
----------------

- Review the Oracle properties in the config.server file.
  You may need to change them to connect to your Oracle instance.

- Start the server:

  $ server

- Start the client in a separate window:

  $ client
